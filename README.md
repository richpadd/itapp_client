This repo holds the client code for the IT Terms website project

**Main App Source Code**

I have included the /src/ folder to the repo in order for the core, original React source code to be viewed, notably admin.js that holds all of my coding for the CRUD admin console web client


**Other Page Source Code**

Index.html, Termilist.html and Termsquiz.html are the other main pages I have developed for the site and are all copied in to the /build folder during each continuous redeployment to production


**React Bundled Code**

/build/ is where the React build process creates the final bundled code, and is the production home folder for rpadd.duckdns.com/

Adminapp.html and the sub-folder /static are the React built final files. Static/CSS also holds the CSS for our three other files above

This information is further detailed in the submitted project documentation
